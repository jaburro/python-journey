Here's the final project of the chapter!

We just got back from a trip to South America, specifically Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. There's some leftover cash in:

🇨🇴 Colombian peso
🇵🇪 Peruvian soles
🇧🇷 Brazilian reais
Create a currency.py program that asks the user for the amount they have in peso, soles, and reais and calculates the total in USD.

Make sure to Google the current exchange rates!
