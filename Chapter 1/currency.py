#Here's the final project of the chapter!

# We just got back from a trip to South America, specifically Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. There's some leftover cash in:

# ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ Colombian peso  1 = 0.000240 USD
# ðŸ‡µðŸ‡ª Peruvian soles 1 = 0.28 USD
# ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Brazilian reais 1 = 0.21 USD
# Create a currency.py program that asks the user for the amount they have in peso, soles, and reais and calculates the total in USD.

# Make sure to Google the current exchange rates!
