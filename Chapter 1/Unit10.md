Here's the final project of the chapter!

We just got back from a trip to South America, specifically Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. There's some leftover cash in:

ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡´ Colombian peso </br>
ğŸ‡µğŸ‡ª Peruvian soles </br>
ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· Brazilian reais </br>
Create a currency.py program that asks the user for the amount they have in peso, soles, and reais and calculates the total in USD.

Make sure to Google the current exchange rates!
