Random
In Python, modules are .py files containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python program. The Python standard library contains well over 200 modules that we can use.

We can use the .randint() function from a module called random to generate a random number from a range.

But first, let's import this module so we can use its functions.

import random

Next, we'll create a variable to store the randomly generated value. Declare a variable called num, and assign it to the function call:

num = random.randint(1, 9)

This will generate a random number between 1 and 9 (inclusive of both).

Together, the code will look like:

import random

num = random.randint(1, 9)

print(num)

The output should be different each time it runs: 2, 8, 5, 9, 2, 1, 3...
