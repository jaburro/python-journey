Since 1927, a rollercoaster known as "The Cyclone" has delighted riders visiting Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York. ðŸŽ¢

The operator of the ride is installing a new entry system (the height requirement is 137 cm and the cost to ride is 10 credits), and needs your help with writing the program for it!

Create a new file called the_cyclone.py.

Ask the user what their height is and how many credits they have using the int() and input() functions. Make sure to store the values in a height variable and a credits variable.

Use a combination of relational and logical operators to create the rules:

If their height is greater than or equal to 137 and their credits is greater than or equal to 10, print "Enjoy the ride!"
Else if their height is less than 137, print "You are not tall enough to ride."
Else if their credits is less than 10, print "You don't have enough credits."
Else, print "Invalid data."
